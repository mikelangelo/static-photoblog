postTitle: "Charlie's First 4th"
postDescription: "We took Charlie to the Lisle Balloon Fest this year for the 4th of July. It was Charlie's very first fireworks show... of course he slept through it...but it was his first nonetheless. I took a bunch of fireworks shots and I didn't have a tripod, so I just restedt the camera on my camera bag and pressed the shutter button. Since I couldn't see through the viewfinder, aiming the camera was a shot in the dark (pun intended). "
