postDescription: "Just got a new lens yesterday. A canon 50mm f/1.8 lens. It's only $80 and for that price, is just a really nice lens. At f/1.8, it is the 'fastest' lens I currently own. I just played around a bit with it. I got that lens because I'll be shooting a boxing match tonight. No flash. Indoors. Poor lighting, etc. I wanted the fastest lens I could manage. If this lens isn't long enough, I may get myself an 85mm 1.4 or 1.8 lens...but that would be expensive... so we'll start with this. I'll be posting some of the fight pics soon, too. Keep checkin'!"
