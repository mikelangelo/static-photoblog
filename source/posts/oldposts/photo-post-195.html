postDescription: "My wife and I went on a hike on a small hill called &lt;a href=&quot;http://azstateparks.com/Parks/parkhtml/picacho.html&quot;&gt;Picacho Peak&lt;/a&gt; 40 miles north of Tuscon, Arizona. It took us about 4 1/2 hours for the whole trail. Most of it is easy..but then you get into the vertical parts... it's about 200 feet high, but we only went to about 1500 feet today."
