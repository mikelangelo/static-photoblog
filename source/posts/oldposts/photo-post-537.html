postDescription: "While in California, we visited a museum in LA. In the courtyard of this museum was this beautiful rose garden. It was filled with flowerbeds with different species of roses. There seemed to be hundreds! It was lovely. In one of the rose beds was this duck. He was VERY brave and was standing only on one leg. We thought he only HAD one leg for a while...but he let me get within just a few feet of him allowing me to get this photo. I hope you like it. If anyone knows what kind of duck this is, could you let me know? \r\n\r\n(*Edit: Thanks to Onno for letting me know that this is a Muscovy duck!)"
