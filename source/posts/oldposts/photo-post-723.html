postDescription: "Here's Charlie talking to a sheep. We visited Kline Creek Farm (part of the DuPage County Forest Preserve). It's a working 1890's farm and we visited their sheep on this day. It was really hot and sunny, so the sheep looked really uncomfortable. This one just stayed by the fenceline. "
