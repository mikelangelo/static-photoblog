postTitle: "Grounded #1"
postDescription: "There's a local VFW (Veteran's of Foreign Wars) nearby my home in West Chicago. They have couple of Howitzers and a old vintage Tank in their front lawn... pretty cool, really. As I was driving home the other day, I saw this plane in their parking lot and I had to stop. I thought it appropriate that it was raining... it's kinda' sad to see such a beautiful machine grounded like this and in pieces. But it looks like it will be set up on display somehow... looking forward to seeing her put all back together again. \r\n\r\nI'll post a few more detail shots over the next couple of days. "
