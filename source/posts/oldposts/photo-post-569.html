postDescription: "This is part of the new children's area of the morton arboretum in Wheaton, IL. It's a nifty rope bridge that's pretty cool. After I went through it (I barely fit), I looked back and saw all the perspective angles. I'd like to go back and take pictures when kids are playing in it. I think that would be cool."
