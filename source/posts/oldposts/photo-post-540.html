postDescription: "I don't really have time to putz with photography, right now, but I had to do something. I have this really old model train set that was my father's and I've been wanting to photograph it. I need to do some restoration work on the pieces (that would be a fun project), but until then, I thought I'd try something very simple. It's cropped tight, because i didn't set up any kind of background or anything. I didn't even take the time to dust it off, as you can probably see. ;)"
