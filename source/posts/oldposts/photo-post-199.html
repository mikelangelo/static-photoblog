postTitle: "Vulture (Turkey... I think)"
postDescription: "This was one of the vultures circling at the top of Picacho Peak. As marvelously close as they did come... I really couldn't get a great pic of them. I was pretty disappointed...but I'll learn some day. I'd like to think that I needed a monopod or some other support to make it work better. This pic is cropped in some...but not a ton. As you can see...it's a smidge grainy."
