postTitle: "Scaredy Sheep!"
postDescription: "My wife and I took our dog, hero, for a walk at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dupageforest.com/EDUCATION/klinecreek.html&quot;&gt;Kline Creek Farm&lt;/a&gt;. It's a working farm just west of Chicago that's part of the DuPage County Forest Preserve. As we were walking through.. Hero decided to go nuts and started barking and tried to &quot;get&quot; the sheep. They all ran into their barn. As Julie took Hero farther away, I stayed with my camera for a moment longer to get their reactions. Here's a photo of them as they are just coming out of the barn to continue eating their hay...but keeping a VERY close eye on where Hero went too.\r\n\r\nedit: forgive the focus. It was quit dark and I didn't have my tripod. I had my camera set to ISO 800 and tried to use the fence as a support. Not to mention the sheep kept moviing. ;-)"
