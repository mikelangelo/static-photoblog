postTitle: "Chicago brick wall..."
postDescription: "I just got my new Tamron 28-75mm 2.8 lens and I just tried it out real quick in the parking garage in downtown Chicago. It was rainy out and dark so I couldn't do much interesting...but I haven't taken pics of a brick wall, yet... so here is my first. \r\n\r\nMy buddy posted photos from when we both went to the Museum of Science and Industry. I must always remember... when you hang out with a photographer... the odds are reasonable that you 'just might' end up in some pics. &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdh.smugmug.com/gallery/971154/1/44740670&quot;&gt;Here's me&lt;/a&gt; as he's showing me his wide angle lens."
