					<p class="intro">Back in the 1900s—yes, before smartphones took over—I started photography as a way to collect reference images for my art studies. Armed with film and a dark room, I discovered a love for photography that just wouldn’t let me go (even though I tried).</p>

					<p class="intro">Now, I’ve channeled that obsession into capturing everything from roaring motorsports and elegant dressage to still life and portraiture. And because I enjoy a challenge, I’ve also ventured into the world of digital magic—graphic design, composite images, and custom edits—because, you know, reality is sometimes overrated.</p>

				This site has the history of my work from early 2000's to about
				2012... Then my site was getting pelted by bots and the comments
				were getting spammed horifically... with a lack of time to deal
				with that issue, I was forced to remove the site. But I kept the
				work. The stories I wanted to share.
			</p> -->
				<!-- <p>
				Now.. many years later.. I find my interest in code and
				photography rekindled. I've recently acquired new equipment. New
				toys. New ideas. Stress from the recent pandemic, work, and
				providing for my amazing family as much as possible, I've
				reacquired my need for a creative outlet. I hope I can provide
				more stories and make the site improve over time.
