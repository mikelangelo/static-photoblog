postDescription: " I thought these clouds were pretty amazing. I took this with my 70-200mm f/4.0 Canon lens, unfortunately. Not really ideal for a landscape shot...but I had to try. The dark clouds in the foreground on the right makes me think of a dragon or an Alien from the movie. I brought up the contrast and saturation a little. That's about it.\r\n\r\nI thought &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photoflavor.com/index.php?id=233&quot; style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;this shot&lt;/a&gt; was pretty marvelous for a sunset shot!"
