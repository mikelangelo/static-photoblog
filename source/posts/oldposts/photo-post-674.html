postDescription: "This crowd was very happy and exuberant and were very excited to get into the venue to get a glimpse of the man of the day. \r\n\r\nAgain... at this point, it was still about 3pm.. not a single return had been announced yet as the polls were still open. Everyone just seemed to know it was time for a change."
