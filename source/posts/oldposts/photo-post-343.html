postDescription: "I had a few minutes before a meeting today. Since I had my camera, I decided to drive around and look for something to photograph. Turns out, I was interested by the fence around a cemetary. It was overcast with a light flurry. I'll put up one more tomorrow that I think is neat because it shows some of the snowflakes frozen in time. "
