postTitle: "Charlie on the move..."
postDescription: "Charlie has been able to spend a bunch of time in our backyard, lately. The weather has been very nice. Here's him walking back toward the house... not really sure what's on his mind. But, then... I never know what's on his mind... unless he's hungry. Then I know what's on his mind."
