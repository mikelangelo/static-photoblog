postTitle: "Old Ford Tractor"
postDescription: "This old Ford tractor was out behind the railroad museum in New Buffalo, MI. I've never seen one quite like this one. It was pretty cool. It appeared to be in working order, still attached to a mower and what appeared to be somewhat fresh oil on the engine. Looks like it could certainly use a tune up. "
