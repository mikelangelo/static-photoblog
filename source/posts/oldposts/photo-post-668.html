postDescription: "I happened to be downtown Chicago on November 4th, 2008... Election Day for President. I went downtown in the early afternoon and as soon as I got of the train I began seeing street vendors selling Obama T-Shirts and Buttons. The closer I got to downtown, the more intense it became. "
