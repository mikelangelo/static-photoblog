postTitle: "Easter Wolverine"
postDescription: "I've been gone for a while. But I hope to be back on track. I have too many photos to count that I have yet to edit. So some of my new posts may have been taken a while ago... others might be recent photos. This one is me having a quick bit of fun with my new buddy. \r\n\r\nMy mom brought this Wolverine bobblehead toy for the boys. They didn't seem very interested, so I seized the opportunity to take him for myself. I love this kind of stuff. I hope to put him in many situations to test his \"mettle\" in various scenarios. I want to find out if he's really the Best there is at what he does. "
