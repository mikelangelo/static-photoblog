postDescription: "I have this thing for rust and fences. They are fun to photograph... I think. Here's an example of both in the same image.\r\n\r\nOn a separate note, I've not been updating this site as often as I've taken photos. I hope to fix that in the near future. I thank you for your continued visits."
