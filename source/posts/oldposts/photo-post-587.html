postDescription: "The forest preserve of DuPage County up here in Illinois nails these numbered tags to many of their trees for research and maintenance purposes. For some strange reason...I seem to be building up a collection of photographs of these tags. Don't ask me why. I guess when walking through a forest, and all I see are trees with shiny, silver little metal dots on them... I have to share. Sharing is fun."
