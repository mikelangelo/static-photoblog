postDescription: "Here's one of the first ones I've posted that's black and white (well... almost black and white), I believe... I used channel mixer to remove the colors and then did a soft blur just to bring the focus even more so to the hilite on the driftwood...I don't normally play this much on a photo...but I thought I'd give it a go. \r\n\r\n"
