postTitle: "Flying into Focus"
postDescription: "This I thought worked out in an interesting fashion. I was in my car when this seagull took off. I tried to snap a shot of the action with my zoom lens, but didn't have time to focus...fortunately, he flew INTO my camera's focus range. Kinda' neat. "
