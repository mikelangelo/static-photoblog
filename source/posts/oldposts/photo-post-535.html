postDescription: "My wife and I went to California for Christmas this year. We met up wtih my brother (who lives out there) and my Mom (who lives in Texas) to go on a short 4 day cruise and then spend Christmas in Cali with my Brother. It was a marvelous Christmas, even if a bit non-traditional. While there, we visited Santa Monica pier. Similar to Navy pier in Chicago. They both have food and attractions and a Ferris wheel. \r\n\r\nAs we got there, we saw a number of people fishing off of the pier. We saw this fella as we got there and he was just calmly trying to untangle his fishing line. I honestly don't know if was successful or not. But i thought it might make for an interesting photograph. I captured a few other folks as they performed or created art on the pier and will post more images soon.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!"
