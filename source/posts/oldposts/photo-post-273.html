postDescription: "This is the last one in this series. \r\n\r\nMy buddy and I went to the museum of Science and Industry today to attend a &quot;Just Show Me&quot; seminar on Digital photography Workflow. We got there early, so we walked around and took a few pics.\r\n\r\nCheck out &lt;a href=&quot;http://rdh.smugmug.com/gallery/971154/1/44740670&quot;&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt;."
