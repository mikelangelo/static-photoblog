postTitle: "Pole Bending"
postDescription: "This is another shot from the Danada Fall Festival on October 8th, 2006. This is Carmen riding Chief. She's demonstrating Western Gaming (i.e., Barrel Racing, Pole Bending, etc.) and she's just finishing her run on a Pole Bending course. In this shot, she's gone through the poles (kind of like a slolam) and she's now got to race back to the starting point as fast as possible for a fast time. Here's she's released all the rain so Chief knows it's time to book it all the way down. \r\n\r\nCarmen is VERY good at what she does. This is my favorite demonstration at the Fall Festival."
