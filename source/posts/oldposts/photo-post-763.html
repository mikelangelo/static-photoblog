postDescription: "We just go back from a vacation to New Buffalo, MI. There is a small railroad museum that Charlie just loved. Out behind the building were two freight cars that we were able to walk through as well as about 50 feet of railroad track that Charlie liked. This is his standard pose when Pappa (me) says \"smile.\""
