postDescription: "I was driving into work this morning and I happened to bring my camera with me today. As I pulled in the parking lot, this guy landed on one of the light posts. Using my car as a stand and a blind, I pulled in front of him with the morning sun behind me and took this shot. I'm not 100% sure if it's a cooper's hawk, redtail, or what. If you happen know, would you let me know??"
