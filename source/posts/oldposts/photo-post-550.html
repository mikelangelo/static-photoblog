postDescription: "I was putzin' in my office the other day with the office's digital camera and apparently, I accidentally took a pick with settings that were WAY off... This is the resulting image. I actually like quite a bit. This is the door frame to my office (taken at an angle). The actual colors of the frame are toupe/off white. Where these colors came from I'll never know...but I thought it was kind of fun. What do you think?"
