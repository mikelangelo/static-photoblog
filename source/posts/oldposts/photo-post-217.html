postDescription: "Here's some buildings in Chicago. I like some of the color, but I really don't like the way the perspective worked out. I need to practice architecture some to learn exactly how it works through the camera's eye. As well as learn how to correct it in Photoshop... I'm just too lazy to look it up at the moment. ;-)\r\n\r\n(edit: I lied... I looked at this photo some more and I really don't like it at all. I don't know why I posted it...but since it's already up... I'll be a man and leave it. sigh. I'll take a better one one of these days... )\r\n\r\nI have my new macro lens...but I don't have time to play with it, yet....whimper. Hopefully this weekend. "
