postTitle: "Turtle, Cat, Rat"
postDescription: "This may be a little weird, but I just recently came into possession of a few skulls, skeleton fragments from various animals. There is a skull of a Turtle, a cat (I think it might by \"fluffy\"...seriously..), and either a rat, a possum or some small animal with huge yellow buck teeth. Anyway, these items are interesting to look at...they are unusual, have great texture, and give me something different to photograph. I have a few specific projects I'm going to try and accomplish with these images, but I'll wait until they're under way before I talk more about those, except to say that I intend to use a lot of photoshop. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking."
