postDescription: "These are the teeth/blades on the back of a manuer spreader at the barn where my wife works. It was very cold this afternoon... in the teens I would say... so I didn't stay long to get a better shot. I kinda' like this one though. No post processing outside of a touch of conttrast. Maybe I should have added a little more contrast. ... oh well. "
