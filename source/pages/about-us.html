	<h2>What is Mikelangelo's Photoblog</h2>
	<p>I have had a strong interest since college (a long time ago, in a state far, far away...). Back in the day, my interest was for the purpose to support my illustration. Realistic photo reference material for my art. I took classes. visualized lighting and poses... </p>

	<p>But since then, my insterest evolved. I have developed a love for the artform of photography itself. Product. Still life. Portraiture. The creative, but also the technical. How does light "work"? </p>

	<p>Add in my love for digital visual manipulation.. aka.. PHOTOSHOP!</p>

	<p>This site has the history of my work from early 2000's to about 2012... Then my site was getting pelted by bots and the comments were getting spammed horifically... with a lack of time to deal with that issue, I was forced to remove the site. But I kept the work. The stories I wanted to share.</p>

	<p>Now.. many years later.. I find my interest in code and photography rekindled. I've recently acquired new equipment. New toys. New ideas. Stress from the recent pandemic, work, and providing for my amazing family as much as possible, I've reacquired my need for a creative outlet. I hope I can provide more stories and make the site improve over time. </p>
