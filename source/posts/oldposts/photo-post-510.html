postDescription: "Well.. .this is Scotch. He's a mustang over at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danada.info&quot;&gt;Danada Equestrian Center&lt;/a&gt; in Wheaton, IL. He's blind in his left eye... as you can probably guess. He's a sweetheart. He was coming over to check me out and the setting sun made his eye kinda' stand out, so I thought this was a nice shot. "
