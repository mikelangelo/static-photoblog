postTitle: "Morning After..."
postDescription: "This morning I was on my way to work and this scene caught my eye... not sure why. Yesterday was a big snowfall in the area.. we got about 8 inches worth or so. It doesn't look too bad, but it was very wet snowand i think it 'packed' itself down... it sure was heavy to shovel..that's for sure. "
