			<h2>About Mikelangelo</h2>
			<p>
				I began learning photography back in the 1900s to create reference photos for my studies in art and illustration. Through those experiences, developing my own film in a dark room, I've never been able to get away from the draw that photography had on me.
			</p>
			<p>
				Since then, my insterest evolved into a passion for the craft. </p>

				This site has the history of my work from early 2000's to about
				2012... Then my site was getting pelted by bots and the comments
				were getting spammed horifically... with a lack of time to deal
				with that issue, I was forced to remove the site. But I kept the
				work. The stories I wanted to share.
			</p> -->

			<!-- <p>
				Now.. many years later.. I find my interest in code and
				photography rekindled. I've recently acquired new equipment. New
				toys. New ideas. Stress from the recent pandemic, work, and
				providing for my amazing family as much as possible, I've
				reacquired my need for a creative outlet. I hope I can provide
				more stories and make the site improve over time.
