postTitle: "Flood effects..."
postDescription: "After our basement was flooded on Labor day this year (we had about 4-6 inches of standing water in the basement), we moved everything out of the basement. Many things didn't get cleaned out for a few days (such as a box containing some old model railroad parts). When I realized that these train tracks were significantly rusted and still wet, I put them out on the back patio table where they have continued to rust as well as begin to collect leaves as Autumn continues on. We had a very nice, sunny day today and i decided to use that pretty light to capture some still lifes with my macro lens. I'll have one more from this bunch to post tomorrow. I'm deciding between two shots... don't know which one, yet. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking. "
