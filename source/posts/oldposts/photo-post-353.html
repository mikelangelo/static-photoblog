postTitle: "Taking off..."
postDescription: "I saw these two Geese in the parking lot of my office the other day and decided to take a few pics. After taking some photos all nice and innocent-like, I started walking closer until they took off to try and capture a shot like this. Unfortunately... there's a bunch of cars in the background. But I like the look of the birds, themselves. \r\n\r\nI can never get shots like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photoflavor.com/index.php?id=351&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; in the wild, so I have try and make my own sometimes. ;)\r\n"
