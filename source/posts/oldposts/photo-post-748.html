postTitle: "Charlie Vacuums... Kinda..."
postDescription: "Charlie like vacuums. This one is a little more top heavy than what he's used to at home. He was trying to tip it back up, but the end table on the right was not helping him, being in his way and all. He's quite strong and can figure out puzzles pretty well when he doesn't get frustrated right away. "
