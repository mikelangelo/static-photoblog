postDescription: "The Winfield Fire Department had an open house and I caught the tail end today. Some of the firefighters were giving a demo as they tore apart some cars with their tools (jaws of life, saws-all, etc.). I stopped long enough to snap a couple of pics. This fire station has done more promotional stuff than any other fire station I've seen. I'm hoping to actually hear about it ahead of time next time to perhaps get some more pics!"
