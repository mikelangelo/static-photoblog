postTitle: "Momma's to be..."
postDescription: "Happy mommies to be. My wife Julie and her horse, Bridgette. We were coming back from U. of I. in Champaign-Urbana (near Springfield, IL) where we visited a specialist to look at Bridgette's baby. We had an initial report that she might be carrying twins... which is, shall we say, &quot;not good&quot; for horses. We drove down in the morning and after over an hour of ultrasounding (internal AND external), it was determined that she is only carrying a single baby. VERY good news, indeed!\r\n\r\nAs my wife, Joolie, is due any day, now... she is VERY relieved that her baby (that is to say, Bridgette) is progressing very well and healthy... hence the smile. A smiling wife is one of the best gifts a person can have. \r\n\r\nTo make this an even MORE interesting year... joolie and I are going to visit a humane shelter tonight where a 3 month old Great Pyrenese is waiting for our visit to see if she'll get along with Hero, our 3 year old Great Pyrenese... whoooo--WEEEE... what a year, huh? I'm sure I'll post images of the new puppy if we bring her home. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!!"
