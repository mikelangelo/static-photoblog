postTitle: "Arizona Mountain Sunrise"
postDescription: "While in Arizona for Christmas this year, I saw some beautiful sunrises (blessing and curse of kids, sometimes as they seem to not like sleeping in). Every morning I saw a different sunrise. This time, the light was cutting through the morning fog...which, when in Tucson, looks cool because it's not there often. "
