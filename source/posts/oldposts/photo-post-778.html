postDescription: "Here's another photo of one of the animal skulls I mentioned the other day. This one, I believe, is fluffy. (Yes, I named my cat \"fluffy\") She was a great cat. My understanding is she disappeared one day from home in Texas... she preferred to be outside... and didn't show up until my mom found what was left (not much). I'm sad that she died alone like that, but she was adamant about being outside, so hopefully, it was they way she wanted to go... when she was a kitten, she would curl up and basically sleep on my head each night (was she trying to smother me?)... and I would wake up covered in \"Fluffy drool\"... yes... she drooled. A lot. "
