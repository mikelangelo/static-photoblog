postTitle: "Picachu Peak "
postDescription: "This is about 1500 feet above the desert floor which about another 1800 feet above see level for a total of 'about' 3300 feet above see level. Took Julie and I about 3 hours to make the round trip hike up and down this peak. With me gaining weight and only 3 months after my wife's C-Section, I thought we did pretty darn good. ;)"
