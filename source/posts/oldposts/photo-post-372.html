postDescription: "This guy has been in the family for a long time. He used to be in a big 'ol fountain that we had...but when that accidentally ran dry, he was stuck 'high and dry' on the rocks. When I found him, I thought him a goner. But he moved, so I quickly put him in the fish tank and he almost immediately started swimming around. I was amazed. I must have gotten there 'just' in the nick of time!! He's been doing great ever since."
