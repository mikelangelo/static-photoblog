postDescription: "So... This is Ms. Kitty. When we moved into our house, the previous owners made sure that we would agree to feed Ms. Kitty. She stays in the vicinity of a few houses and we all take care of her a little bit. Everyday after work, she comes over says &quot;Meow, meow&quot; in her &quot;smoker's-meow&quot; kinda' way. Which means &quot;Feed ME!&quot; Which Julie and I do. She eats well. "
