postTitle: "Arbor Reflections"
postDescription: "I saw this reflection of a tree when my wife and I were walking in the Morton Arboretum. I have never taken a picture of a reflection before and thought I'd try it. I was fairly please with the result. This was taken about a month ago. The sun hasn't been out in about a week. I'm getting to work before daylight and then I get out of work and go to class after dark... sigh. I'm in a window office...but it's so overcast that it doesn't even look like daytime when it's time for lunch. Very gloomy. \r\n\r\nNormally, I'm okay with that...but with classes starting up yesterday and my long hours lately... I feel like I'm in a movie like the matrix where everything is kind of gloom-filled/moody with no sun. Except I'm not Neo, so I'm stuck in this reality. Weird. "
