postDescription: "These are cavaleties. They are used like trot poles to assist in the training of a horse and rider. The advantage of cavaleties is that you can rotate them to 4 different positions allowing for 4 different heights ranging from 4-6 inches up to about 12 inches off the ground. This provides a good range to many riding levels and varying types of excercises. "
