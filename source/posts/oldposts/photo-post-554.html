postTitle: "Milwaukee Art Museum #1"
postDescription: "My wife and I went to Milwaukee this past weekend for my cousins wedding. (Congratulations Jeff and Tina!!) It was a beautiful service and just a great weekend. The hotel we stayed at was just a few blocks from Lake Michigan and also the Milwaukee Art Museum. The architecture of this facility is amazing. It looks like a sailing vessel from the days of old (but in a 'futuristic' sense). The &quot;sails&quot; open when the facility opens and they fold down over the windows when the facility closes.\r\n\r\nThis image appears to be the 'classic' iconic look of the building and is used in much of the imagery for Milwaukee. I have two more to post that will give you a sense of the building from other angles and it's overall presence. "
