postTitle: "Old fashioned Camera at the Obama Rally"
postDescription: "This was possibly my favorite photo of the day. There was a photographer using this old style camera that I just enjoyed watching. She had to have a heavy opaque blanket/cover over herself and her camera to expose a plate (just like you see in the old movies). The back of the camera was a piece of glass with a grid on it that the photogapher could use to compose her shot. As you can see... there is not corrective lens to right the image. She views it upside down. If my observations prove true... I believe the subject is the photographer's mother.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking. "
