postTitle: "Fence with Horses"
postDescription: "I was trying to play with the Depth of Field a little bit. But I don't think I pushed it enough. I think I should have tried to get the fence post a bigger and the background more out of focus. But, I couldn't get any closer to this post so it was difficult."
