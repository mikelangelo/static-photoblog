postDescription: "This isa restored Windmill in Batavia, Illinois off of Route 25 on the edge of the Fox River. I was driving by this weekend and had to stop. I had never seen it before. I still have some work to do on my composition and post processing, but I was short for time. I'll post another shot of it tomorrow. "
