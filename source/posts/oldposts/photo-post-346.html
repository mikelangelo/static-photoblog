postTitle: "What's her name? #2"
postDescription: "This here be my wife's and mine new dog. She's about 3 years old. She's a purebred bloodhound. We got her from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midwestbloodhoundrescue.com/&quot;&gt;Midwest Bloodhound Rescue&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon. \r\n\r\nI call this 'What's her name?' because her current name is 'Dixie.' We're thinking we'll give her a new name, but have yet to decide. Suggestions?\r\n\r\n(*Edit: unfortunately, Dixie wasn't working out well with our other dog Hero, so we had to bring her back to the rescue facility.)"
