postDescription: "These are some of the harness bells that are used at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danada.info&quot;&gt;Danada Equestrian Center&lt;/a&gt; in Wheaton, IL. I took a bunch of photos today and will be posting some more over the next few days. I was looking for simple subjects inside the barn as it was snowing and I really didn't want to get snow on my lens. I've got some more geese photos as they're feeding in the snow at the barn."
