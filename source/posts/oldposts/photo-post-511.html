postTitle: "Poor wasp..."
postDescription: "Okay... I finished mowing the lawn. I put the mower in the shed. As I'm leaving the shed, I see this poor guy STUCK to the door. It's as if he was aiming to stick me, I ducked, and he got stuck in the wall. He was still alive, too. He was somewhat moving, still at this point. Most interesting."
