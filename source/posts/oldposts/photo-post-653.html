postTitle: "Logging show at the fair"
postDescription: "When we went to the Lisle Balloon fest on the 4th of July, they had a number of events/activities. This is a logging show/demonstration. This guy was racing another fellow...they had to grab their chainsaw, run up the angled log, start the saw, and cut off the top of the vertical log. Kinda' neat. We were rooting for the red team and this was our red contestant. "
