postDescription: "This is Paul. My friend's son. He was at the Danada Fall Festival on Sunday. One of the activities that occurs is all the kids that made a stick horse get to join in the 'Stick Horse Romp' around the arena. While he was running around, I was trying to get his photo. Now... I was running out of disk space mighty fast and only had a few shots left. I got to the other side of the arena in time to meet up with Paul and his parents. When we got there, his father said &quot;hey Paul, turn around so Mike can take your picture.&quot; Without skipping a beat, he just turned and knelt on one knee. I took the shot and it was my last shot of the day as all of my memory cards were full. I thought it a great pose. "
