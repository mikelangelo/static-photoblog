postDescription: "Ok... here's another close up image using the cheap close-up filter. In my wife's flower garden, I saw this big 'ol spider just lurking... waiting...I never could quite get his head in focus...but I realized...he was supposed to be hiding..so if I was a bug crawling on this plant..this is what I might see before I peed myself and then got eaten by this giant spider.
