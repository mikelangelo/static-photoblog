postDescription: "Same scene as yesterday, I know... it's been slow for photography lately. I've been so busy I haven't been able to get out. I hope to get something more interesting soonish. \r\nI'd love to have something interesting such as a <a href=\"http://www.chromasia.com/iblog/archives/0802062128.php\">ferry that gets blown ashore by a storm</a> near Liverpool, England. Now THAT would be worth photographing!!\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!"
