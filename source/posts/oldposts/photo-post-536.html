postDescription: "This is another photo from Santa Monica Pier. This guy just had music playing on his boombox and just made the puppet 'kinda' dance around. He wasn't very good. There was no 'act.' I think he was going for the 'pity' effect to get donations. He never once looked up. Just kept making the puppet dance... kinda'. "
