postTitle: "Screech Owl #1"
postDescription: "This guy was also present at the Fall Festival a few weeks ago. He was just beautiful. Again, rescued (like this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikelangelo.com/blog/index.php?showimage=568&quot;&gt;hawk&lt;/a&gt;) and wouldn't be able to survive in the wild. As such, he's then used for educational purposes. The background cam out this dark already, which I was happy with, because all the details in the owl came out well. Tomorrow's shot is a close up of his claws on the handler's glove. \r\n\r\nEdit: After some feedback, I've re-uploaded this image. I increased the saturation of the color in the eye to allow it to pop a little more. I hope you like it. "
