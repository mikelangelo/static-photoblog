postDescription: "She is from WBEZ. A Chicago station for NPR covering the Peace event where Cindy Sheehan was speaking. After interviewing many people, she held her microphone by the speaker to record all that was said. I have yet to find out who she is..I am uncertain if she is an on-air personality."
