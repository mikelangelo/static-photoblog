postTitle: "Fall at Starved Rock #2"
postDescription: "Here's another from Starved Rock. Apparently, Bald Eagles LOVE this place in winter time. They come to nest during winter and are very common around January. Last year, I was told they had up to 100 Eagles in the area. There is a canal nearby with a damn that keeps the water from freezing and provides a marvelous feeding location for eagles. I'm going to attempt to take a trip back here in January and try and capture some photos of Eagles. That would be a first for me!"
