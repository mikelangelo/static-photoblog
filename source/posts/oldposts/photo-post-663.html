postTitle: "American Kestrel"
postDescription: "This is an American Kestrel. The Willowbrook Forest Preserve of DuPage County takes in injured native animals and nurses them back to health. If they recover, they are released back into the wild. If there injuries will be a permanent issue for them and prevent the animal from thriving in the wild (well, the wild of suburbia) then they will often care for the animal and use them for educational purposes. In this instance, this Kestrel was being used at the Danada Fall Festival in that purpose."
