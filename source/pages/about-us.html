			<h2>About Mikelangelo</h2>
			<p>
				I have had a strong interest in photography since college (a long time ago, in
				a state far, far away...). Back in the day, my interest was for
				the purpose to support my illustration. Realistic photo
				reference material for my art. I took classes. visualized
				lighting and poses...
			</p>

			<p>
				But since then, my insterest evolved. I have developed a love
				for the artform of photography itself. Product. Still life.
				Portraiture. The creative, but also the technical. How does
				light "work"?
			</p>

			<p>
				Add in my love for digital visual manipulation.. aka..
				PHOTOSHOP!
			</p>

			<p>
				This site has the history of my work from early 2000's to about
				2012... Then my site was getting pelted by bots and the comments
				were getting spammed horifically... with a lack of time to deal
				with that issue, I was forced to remove the site. But I kept the
				work. The stories I wanted to share.
			</p>

			<p>
				Now.. many years later.. I find my interest in code and
				photography rekindled. I've recently acquired new equipment. New
				toys. New ideas. Stress from the recent pandemic, work, and
				providing for my amazing family as much as possible, I've
				reacquired my need for a creative outlet. I hope I can provide
				more stories and make the site improve over time.
