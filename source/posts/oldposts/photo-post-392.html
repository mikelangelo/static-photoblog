postDescription: "This guy (and his girlfriend) flew right in front of me to land in this small piece of water! I was looking through my camera at something else and didn't see them until they almost landed. They were very brave, I was only about 10 feet away when they landed. But he kept his eye on me. If I made a wrong move, he would perk right up and start moving away. The whole time hs girlfriend just kept eating. figures. Women! (just kidding)\r\n\r\nThis was taken with my brand new 1.4x teleconverter onmy 70-200L lens. I was very happy with it's clarity and image quality. But I also had very nice light as the afternoon began to fade into evening."
