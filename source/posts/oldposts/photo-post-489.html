postDescription: "At &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danada.info&quot;&gt;Danada&lt;/a&gt;, you can often find birds just sitting on the backs/butts of the horses. The other day, I went to the barn with my wife early one morning. While she rode her horse, I captured some examples of animals just getting along. This little bird is sitting on Moxy, and that's Aiden's big butt next to her."
