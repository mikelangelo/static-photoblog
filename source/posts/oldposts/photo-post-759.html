postDescription: "I finally got my \"dream\" camera... or at least until I win the lottery. Went to a Heron rookery nearby my work. Saw about a dozen or so Great Blue Herons in trees about 30-50 feet off the ground. These birds are pretty amazing. They have such grace for their size, I was stunned to watch them take offand land in their nests...they so gracefully walk on the air to gently land. \r\n\r\nI couldn't even see the trees/branches move much when they landed. Anyway, here's the first of MANY image from my new camera."
