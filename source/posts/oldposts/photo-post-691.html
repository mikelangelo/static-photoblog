postTitle: "Turkey Vulture #1"
postDescription: "On my way home today, I drove through Joliet, IL. Nearby was this tall, concrete silo. On top of it were sitting two large Turkey Vultures. I've never seen turkey vultures in the wild. This was very exciting to me. This is one of them. Tomorrow, I'll post a picture of the one that flew away."
