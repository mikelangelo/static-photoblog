  postTitle: "Cavaleties"
  postDescription:: "These are cavaleties. They are used like trot poles to assist in the training of a horse and rider. The advantage of cavaleties is that you can rotate them to 4 different positions allowing for 4 different heights ranging from 4-6 inches up to about 12 inches off the ground. This provides a good range to many riding levels and varying types of excercises. "

  postTitle: "Watering the Arena"
  postDescription:: "Here, a staff member at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.danada.info&quot;&gt;Danada Equestrian Center&lt;/a&gt; is watering the arena before a lesson to reduce the amount of dust during practice. If the horses breath in too much dust, over time, they can develop a cough or breathing problems. Danada recently got a  new watering taank on a trailer so it takes about 5 minutes to sufficiently water the arena whereas before it too a good 1/2 hour with the use of a sprinkler that they had to move several times to cover the whole arena.

She was fine, sniffing the flowers and checking things out...when a duck flew off about 15 feet away from hero in the water. Apparently... a duck taking off is the thing that will make Hero jump in a lake! I WISH I was quicker... it would have been such a great shot to get her as she realized that she jumped into water that was deeper than she was, tall!! \r\n\r\nSo... she jumped... thought 'OH Crap!,' and jumped right back out again. I was at least able to get a pic of her trying to shake it off!! Julie and I almost fell over laughing!!"

  postDescription:: "Here's a Barn Owl that was part of the Raptor Free Flight demonstration at the Desert Museum. I was amazed at how silent this owl was when in flight or landing. Apparently, the feathers are so soft, that they absorb any sound and are virtually silent."

It's a working farm just west of Chicago that's part of the DuPage County Forest Preserve. As we were walking through.. Hero decided to go nuts and started barking and tried to &quot;get&quot; the sheep. They all ran into their barn. As Julie took Hero farther away, I stayed with my camera for a moment longer to get their reactions. Here's a photo of them as they are just coming out of the barn to continue eating their hay...but keeping a VERY close eye on where Hero went too.  \r\n\r\nedit: forgive the focus. It was quit dark and I didn't have my tripod. I had my camera set to ISO 800 and tried to use the fence as a support. Not to mention the sheep kept moviing. ;-)"

I was fairly please with the result. This was taken about a month ago. The sun hasn't been out in about a week. I'm getting to work before daylight and then I get out of work and go to class after dark... sigh. I'm in a window office...but it's so overcast that it doesn't even look like daytime when it's time for lunch. Very gloomy. \r\n\r\nNormally, I'm okay with that...but with classes starting up yesterday and my long hours lately... I feel like I'm in a movie like the matrix where everything is kind of gloom-filled/moody with no sun. Except I'm not Neo, so I'm stuck in this reality. Weird. "

If I made a wrong move, he would perk right up and start moving away. The whole time hs girlfriend just kept eating. figures. Women! (just kidding)\r\n\r\nThis was taken with my brand new 1.4x teleconverter onmy 70-200L lens. I was very happy with it's clarity and image quality. But I also had very nice light as the afternoon began to fade into evening."

As difficult as it is to anticipate animal's behavior/actions, I could use a faster camera. I can take up to 4 images with my camera before I have to wait as it writes those images to the memory card. I often miss a lot of shots as a result. However, if I can become a better photographer with the limitations of  my camera, I'll become that much better when I am able to get the 30D... and I'll save $1400. ;)"

  postDescription:: "I was helping a friend of mine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdhphotography.com/&quot;&gt;Rob Dehaan&lt;/a&gt;, at a photo shoot for a sorority/fraternity conference he was shooting. We arrived early and set up a couple of lights outside for group portraits. I went out a couple of times to check on the lights. I saw this guy walking along the pond's edge. But, I left my camera inside. I came out 45 minutes or so later and he was STILL there... I slapped myself in the forehead for leaving the camera inside... again. Well.. the third time's the charm. about 45 minutes later... I checked the lights... he hadn't moved. And THIS time, I had my camera. \r\n\r\nThe day was HOT and MUGGY... blech. I think he was trying to stay cool in the shade of the tree. The light area on his neck, just under his chin/bill, was fluttering, I believe in an attempt to stay cool.\r\n\r\nThis guy was incredibly brave. He allowed me to get within 30 feet or so of him before he began to move away. I had my Canon 70-200 with 1.4x Teleconverter.\r\n\r\nThe only bummer is he really DIDN'T move. Most of the shots are the same. I'll post one more of him tomorrow..but the two pics will be similar. Nothing earth Shattering in these pics...but it's the closest I've ever gotten to a Blue Heron... It was a good day.\r\n\r\nJust for the record...here's an example of what I'd like to be able to capture someday: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photoflavor.com/index.php?id=417&quot;&gt;Photoflavor&lt;/a&gt;."

She is exceptional at this fall when she's NOT wearing a big, foam Sumo suit. The fact that she can do this WEARING this big, foam Sumo suit... is incredible. Especially since the suit probably weighs as much, if not more, than SHE DOES! As a side note, my camera's buffer filled up before I could get the last shot, but she DID land this fall correctly... It was very impressive!\r\n\r\n(as a side note... I will probably be 'bloodied' for posting this series...but it will be worth it.)"

I was running out of disk space mighty fast and only had a few shots left. I got to the other side of the arena in time to meet up with Paul and his parents. When we got there, his father said &quot;hey Paul, turn around so Mike can take your picture.&quot; Without skipping a beat, he just turned and knelt on one knee. I took the shot and it was my last shot of the day as all of my memory cards were full. I thought it a great pose. "

In this shot, she's gone through the poles (kind of like a slolam) and she's now got to race back to the starting point as fast as possible for a fast time. Here's she's released all the rain so Chief knows it's time to book it all the way down. \r\n\r\nCarmen is VERY good at what she does. This is my favorite demonstration at the Fall Festival."

  postTitle: "Screech Owl #1"
  postDescription:: "This guy was also present at the Fall Festival a few weeks ago. He was just beautiful. Again, rescued (like this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikelangelo.com/blog/index.php?showimage=568&quot;&gt;hawk&lt;/a&gt;) and wouldn't be able to survive in the wild. As such, he's then used for educational purposes. The background cam out this dark already, which I was happy with, because all the details in the owl came out well. Tomorrow's shot is a close up of his claws on the handler's glove. \r\n\r\nEdit: After some feedback, I've re-uploaded this image. I increased the saturation of the color in the eye to allow it to pop a little more. I hope you like it. "

  postTitle: "Fall is here..."
  postDescription:: "I took a walk this morning at a local forest preserve before work. It was very dark/overcast and wet and dreary...but I thought it was very nice, actually. Everything was wet, so there were rich colors and in the distance you could see a nice haze in the atmosphere. I went out with the idea of capturing &quot;Autumn.&quot; The most obvious choice is the turning color of leaves as the forest goes dormant for the winter. Today's and tomorrow's shots focus on this. Of course... this is all open to interpretation if I accomplished my goal or not."

  postDescription:: "After our basement was flooded on Labor day this year (we had about 4-6 inches of standing water in the basement), we moved everything out of the basement. Many things didn't get cleaned out for a few days (such as a box containing some old model railroad parts). When I realized that these train tracks were significantly rusted and still wet, I put them out on the back patio table where they have continued to rust as well as begin to collect leaves as Autumn continues on. We had a very nice, sunny day today and i decided to use that pretty light to capture some still lifes with my macro lens. I'll have one more from this bunch to post tomorrow. I'm deciding between two shots... don't know which one, yet. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking. "

It was a marvelous Christmas, even if a bit non-traditional. While there, we visited Santa Monica pier. Similar to Navy pier in Chicago. They both have food and attractions and a Ferris wheel. \r\n\r\nAs we got there, we saw a number of people fishing off of the pier. We saw this fella as we got there and he was just calmly trying to untangle his fishing line. I honestly don't know if was successful or not. But i thought it might make for an interesting photograph. I captured a few other folks as they performed or created art on the pier and will post more images soon.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking!"

The hotel we stayed at was just a few blocks from Lake Michigan and also the Milwaukee Art Museum. The architecture of this facility is amazing. It looks like a sailing vessel from the days of old (but in a 'futuristic' sense). The &quot;sails&quot; open when the facility opens and they fold down over the windows when the facility closes.\r\n\r\nThis image appears to be the 'classic' iconic look of the building and is used in much of the imagery for Milwaukee. I have two more to post that will give you a sense of the building from other angles and it's overall presence. "

In retrospect, I should have either whipped out my macro, or perhaps my 70-200 so I could keep a farther distance. He might have hung around a little longer before hopping away. \r\n\r\nAs we left, we noticed a mother come and try and capture him. I have  no idea why, and we didn't stay long enough to find out. \r\n\r\nI hope he's ok. He was a good model."

As I began walking through the arboretum, I followed the noise. \r\n\r\nI started looking on a large tree where I saw the first 'empty shell'. As I began to photograph it, I noticed something move on the trunk. It was the first live cicada that I saw... then I saw another and another. The next tree I went to, it was the same thing. A Cicada here. A Cicada there. Then, I took a step back... OMG...every leaf on that tree had several empty cicada shell/exosckeleton on it...there were thousands... I just couldn't 'see' them at first. Then, I stopped and began looking... the tree was 'moving'...there were thousands and thousands of them... it was amazing!!\r\n\r\nI'll be  posting a few more shots of Cicadas over the next few days.

I forgot how hard it is to keep up with a munchkin...it's even harder to try to stay ahead of them to get the good shot! This is really the only shot (out of 600) where she's looking AT the camera AND smiling! \r\n\r\nI'll have more to post, but it'll take me a while to go through them all... "

  postDescription:: "Happy mommies to be. My wife Julie and her horse, Bridgette. We were coming back from U. of I. in Champaign-Urbana (near Springfield, IL) where we visited a specialist to look at Bridgette's baby. We had an initial report that she might be carrying twins... which is, shall we say, &quot;not good&quot; for horses. We drove down in the morning and after over an hour of ultrasounding (internal AND external), it was determined that she is only carrying a single baby. VERY good news, indeed!\r\n\r\nAs my wife, Joolie, is due any day, now... she is VERY relieved that her baby (that is to say, Bridgette) is progressing very well and healthy... hence the smile. A smiling wife is one of the best gifts a person can have. \r\n\r\nTo make this an even MORE interesting year... joolie and I are going to visit a humane shelter tonight where a 3 month old Great Pyrenese is waiting for our visit to see if she'll get along with Hero, our 3 year old Great Pyrenese... whoooo--WEEEE... what a year, huh? I'm sure I'll post images of the new puppy if we bring her home. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking!!"

She's an 11 week old great Pyrenese. We had an inside track to the Humane society (Thanks Ann!), so we were able to get grubby paws on her (pun intended) before anyone else. BWAAHAAHAhahahahaaa... uhm.. yah... anyway... Hero and Hattie got to get acquainted for about and hour or so and they seemed to get along very well. They played... we laughed, we cried... two thumbs up all around. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This image is a composite of two shots of Hattie..it was very dark and I was using my new 17-40 f/4.0 L lens...I wasn't thinking or I would have used the nifty 50 at f/1.8 for better results in the dark... oh well.. although not particularly good in the technical sense... I kinda' like how this came out.  &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Oh.. and we might change her name... Hattie was given to her by her previous owner or the humane society, I'm not sure...but we haven't decided, yet.&lt;/p&gt;"

All seems most groovy.\r\n\r\nThanks to all who've supported/helped us through this process. A big thanks goes to the nursing staff at Central DuPage Hospital... ESPECIALLY Cheryl (day shift) and Kristin (Night Shift)... they were extremely helpful and supportive and kept Julie's spirits up through the tough parts and truly made this experience as comfortable as possible for Julie. Thanks to all of you. \r\n\r\nHe was born 8lbs, 11oz. and 21 inches long. Big and strong... just like his Dad... ;)"

  postDescription:: "This is the last shot in this series... I can't wait to see this plane assembled. I like the surface texture myself. From a distance, she looks smooth and aerodynamic, but when you get close you can see the thousands of bolds and rivets used to assemble all the parts... Kind of reminds me of when you look really close at your skin and you begin to see the incredible detail and texture that you don't normally notice... "

As a volunteer at the Danada Equestrian Center, I was fortunate to take part in a tour of the facility as it is being prepared for its Grand Opening this spring on Memorial Day. This building was built around 1931. It's a beautiful barn and I'm really looking forward to its renovation not ony aesthetically but also practically, as I believe it will be used again to house horses. \r\n\r\nI went with the Black and White treatment of this image considering the age and condition of the building. Once it is renovated, I hope to revisit it and take another similar shot that I hope to share in full color. "

  postTitle: "Barn... thingy... "
  postDescription:: "This is a device that is at the Danada Equestrian Center. It's in the back near the Tool Shed and doesn't get used. It's intended for horses that are a little ornery to somewhat restrain them when they are getting shoed, if I'm not mistaken. It has a bit of a 'medieval' feel to, tho', I think. Also, I'd wager that being restrained would actually make it MORE difficult to work with a horse. If they try to fight against the restraints, they might spook and things would not be pleasant. \r\n\r\nOh.. and today was just a marvelously sunny and pleasant day! The first I've seen in a long while!"

If there injuries will be a permanent issue for them and prevent the animal from thriving in the wild (well, the wild of suburbia) then they will often care for the animal and use them for educational purposes. In this instance, this Kestrel was being used at the Danada Fall Festival in that purpose."

The back of the camera was a piece of glass with a grid on it that the photogapher could use to compose her shot. As you can see... there is not corrective lens to right the image. She views it upside down. If my observations prove true... I believe the subject is the photographer's mother.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking. "

  postDescription:: "ok... so I LOVE SPAM. The only thing that might be better is bacon! BUT... it's not really healthy, so I don't get it often. Which is probably why I happen to still like SPAM...because I don't eat it often. Anyway, to commemorate the most recent sacrifice to the gods of obesity, I decided to immortalize the last can of SPAM that I had. I've been saving this thing for weeks...now that I've photographed it... i can move on to bigger and better things... such as the aforementioned Bacon! Thanks for looking."

Saw about a dozen or so Great Blue Herons in trees about 30-50 feet off the ground. These birds are pretty amazing. They have such grace for their size, I was stunned to watch them take off  and land in their nests...they so gracefully walk on the air to gently land. \r\n\r\nI couldn't even see the trees/branches move much when they landed. Anyway, here's the first of MANY image from my new camera."

There is a skull of a Turtle, a cat (I think it might by \"fluffy\"...seriously..), and either a rat, a possum or some small animal with huge yellow buck teeth. Anyway, these items are interesting to look at...they are unusual, have great texture, and give me something different to photograph. I have a few specific projects I'm going to try and accomplish with these images, but I'll wait until they're under way before I talk more about those, except to say that I intend to use a lot of photoshop. :)\r\n\r\nThanks for looking."

  postDescription:: "Here's another photo of one of the animal skulls I mentioned the other day. This one, I believe, is fluffy. (Yes, I named my cat \"fluffy\") She was a great cat. My understanding is she disappeared one day from home in Texas... she preferred to be outside... and didn't show up until my mom found what was left (not much). I'm sad that she died alone like that, but she was adamant about being outside, so hopefully, it was they way she wanted to go... when she was a kitten, she would curl up and basically sleep on my head each night (was she trying to smother me?)... and I would wake up covered in \"Fluffy drool\"... yes... she drooled. A lot. "
