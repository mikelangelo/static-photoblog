postDescription: "This is the last shot in this series... I can't wait to see this plane assembled. I like the surface texture myself. From a distance, she looks smooth and aerodynamic, but when you get close you can see the thousands of bolds and rivets used to assemble all the parts... Kind of reminds me of when you look really close at your skin and you begin to see the incredible detail and texture that you don't normally notice... "
