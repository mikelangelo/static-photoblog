postTitle: "Chicago Police en mas"
postDescription: "As I got closer to the event location (Congress and Michigan Ave) a huge line of people became visible. Cops were on every street corner in groups no smaller than 3 but often in groups larger than 6. Here's a look at one group. All the police I saw and talked to were very friendly and helpful. I didn't see anything that showed tension. Everyone in the crowd was just happy. And the returns hadn't even come in, yet. "
