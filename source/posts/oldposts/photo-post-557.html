postDescription: "While visiting milwaukee, my wife and I walked around the Milwaukee Art museum. As we walked around on the grass, I noticed something move by my feet. it was this little guy. Actually, I thought he was pretty big. So, I proceeded to see how close I could get to him. My lens was about 4 inches in front of him in this shot. In retrospect, I should have either whipped out my macro, or perhaps my 70-200 so I could keep a farther distance. He might have hung around a little longer before hopping away. \r\n\r\nAs we left, we noticed a mother come and try and capture him. I haveno idea why, and we didn't stay long enough to find out. \r\n\r\nI hope he's ok. He was a good model."
