postDescription: "I don't remember where I was in the house, but I found this small, sad looking flower/twig. Someone obviously brought it in the house unknowingly. It is very small. each flower is maybe .25cm in diameter. For some reason it just caught my eye and I decided to make it look bigger.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking. "
