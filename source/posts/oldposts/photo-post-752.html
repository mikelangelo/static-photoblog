postDescription: "ok... so I LOVE SPAM. The only thing that might be better is bacon! BUT... it's not really healthy, so I don't get it often. Which is probably why I happen to still like SPAM...because I don't eat it often. Anyway, to commemorate the most recent sacrifice to the gods of obesity, I decided to immortalize the last can of SPAM that I had. I've been saving this thing for weeks...now that I've photographed it... i can move on to bigger and better things... such as the aforementioned Bacon! Thanks for looking."
