postDescription: "Went to a horse show this weekend to meet up with my wife. Watchin' the kids and taking photos. Part way through the day, someone parks this beautiful Buick 8 next to us. I've never seen one before. It looked beautiful. The chrome was amazing. Had to snap a few pics before it was too late."
