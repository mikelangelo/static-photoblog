postDescription: "This is a shot of the interior of an old, closed down Brach's Candy Company Factory. At the &lt;a href=&quot;http://northamerica.photobloggers.org/&quot;&gt;North American Photoblogger&lt;/a&gt; Meetup in Chicago this weekend (April 27-29, 2007), a fellow photoblogger, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thomasmarlow.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thomas Marlow&lt;/a&gt; led a group of us to this industrial building to take some shots. Take a look at one of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thomasmarlow.com/general/photos/153&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Thomas' shots from this facility&lt;/a&gt;.\r\n\r\nI'll be posting another from this facility tomorrow.
