postTitle: "Patriotic Guitar Man"
postDescription: "This gentleman was singing about Obama. He was telling us that the cops wouldn't let him sing. I think it was more along the lines of he wasn't allowed to be somewhere. There were VERY strict rules about what visitors could bring into the rally. I'm guessing his guitar was not allowed. "
