postDescription: "Julie and I went to the Danada Fall Festival yesterday. Spectacular day! Sunny and toasty. Charlie got to play in the straw playpen and seemed to be good with it. I ended up with more photos of the boy than horses or events...but I guess that's to be expected from his Dad, huh? Thanks for looking!"
