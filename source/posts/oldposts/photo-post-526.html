postTitle: "Fall is here..."
postDescription: "I took a walk this morning at a local forest preserve before work. It was very dark/overcast and wet and dreary...but I thought it was very nice, actually. Everything was wet, so there were rich colors and in the distance you could see a nice haze in the atmosphere. I went out with the idea of capturing &quot;Autumn.&quot; The most obvious choice is the turning color of leaves as the forest goes dormant for the winter. Today's and tomorrow's shots focus on this. Of course... this is all open to interpretation if I accomplished my goal or not."
