postDescription: "This is another shot of the interior of an old, closed down Brach's Candy Company Factory. At the &lt;a href=&quot;http://northamerica.photobloggers.org/&quot;&gt;North American Photoblogger&lt;/a&gt; Meetup in Chicago this weekend (April 27-29, 2007).A group of us went to this closed factory building to take some shots. \r\n\r\nI call it 'Urban Spelunking'. I don't know if it's original...but it describes it well. The place was dark, eerie, and was dripping water everyhere."
