postDescription: "yep...Grant Park in Chicago waiting for Star Wars to start. Between Obi Won and D.V. is my friend Jen. I honestly don't know who knows more about Star Wars... her or George Lucas? (My friend Zach is also in that 'Star Wars Nut' category.)\r\n\r\nOh yeah... and the storm trooper was too short to be a storm trooper. sigh. Those 6th generation clones just aren't the same, ya' know?"
