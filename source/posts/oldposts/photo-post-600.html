postDescription: "Well.. .this one came off a little like a snapshot...but I think it's a great shot. This is a fairly accurate representation of our family. All focused on different things. Charles looking at Hero. Haley looking at Charles. Hero, myself, and Julie looking at the Camera... and we \"think\" that Charles and Haley (the two babies) are doing what we (the adults) want them to... not so much! ;-) Thanks for looking."
