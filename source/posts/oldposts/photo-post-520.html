postTitle: "hawkeye"
postDescription: "This hawk was a rescue from the Willowbrook Forest Preserve in Glen Ellyn, IL. They brought a few raptors to the Danada Equestrian Center Fall Festival. One of which was this rescued hawk. They believe he was hit by a car as a result of severe muscle tissuedamage. They also had to remove his eye surgically. Since he can't fly or see well enough to be able to live in the wild, they keep him and use him in their educational programs."
