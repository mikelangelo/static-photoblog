postDescription: "My friend, Rob, is a photographer and has more lighting equipment than I do. I arranged an afternoon with him to take some portrait shots of Charlie so that I'd have some nice images for family and friends.This is one of the shots that he took (we both took shots). Charlie was just SUPER easy to work with! I'm sure we'll get to do it again in the future.\r\n\r\nIf you would like to see more of my friends work (weddings, portraits, etc.), visit his website at <a href=\"http://www.rdhphotography.com\">www.rdhphotography.com</a> or at his smugmug site: <a href=\"http://www.rdh.smugmug.com/\">rdh.smugmug.com</a>."
