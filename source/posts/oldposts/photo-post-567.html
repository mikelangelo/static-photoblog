postTitle: "Another Yellow Flower..."
postDescription: "Went to the Morton Arboretum (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mortonarb.org&quot;&gt;http://www.mortonarb.org&lt;/a&gt;) on July 4th with my wife and her family. They just finished a new childrens area that was really, really cool. Took this shot on the way out. I'll have a couple more to post soon. I hope everyone had a great Fourth of July! Thanks for looking!"
