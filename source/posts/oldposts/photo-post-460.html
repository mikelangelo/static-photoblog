postTitle: "BRrrrr..... that's cold!"
postDescription: "Just caught this guy getting out of the water. I'm seriously trying to figure out how to get the Canon 30D camera. As difficult as it is to anticipate animal's behavior/actions, I could use a faster camera. I can take up to 4 images with my camera before I have to wait as it writes those images to the memory card. I often miss a lot of shots as a result. However, if I can become a better photographer with the limitations ofmy camera, I'll become that much better when I am able to get the 30D... and I'll save $1400. ;)"
