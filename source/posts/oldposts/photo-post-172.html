postDescription: "I was sitting at my desk trying to figure out what I wanted to shoot for the Photo Friday challenge of '&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photofriday.com/archives/challenge/000476.php&quot;&gt;Complexity&lt;/a&gt;.' Well... right in front of my face above my desk are some of my reference books. Now... that's complexity... well... it can be, anyway."
