postTitle: "What do you want NOW?!"
postDescription: "Hero is 100 lbs. She loves to curl up on the couch and she looks REALLY cute, because according to all of the laws of physics that I'm aware of, it shouldn't be possible for her to contort her canine body in such ways and only take up a single seat on the couch. Recently, she's taken to using the pillow on the couch as well and she just looks uber cute... Ãƒ?ber cute!\r\n\r\nShe just seemed so annoyed when I took pictures... :)"
