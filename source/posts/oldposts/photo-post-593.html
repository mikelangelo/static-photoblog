postTitle: "HEEEeeeeeeeeerrrrrree'sss CHARLIE!"
postDescription: "Well.. .here we are... Charlie has finally arrived ... officially <strong>Charles</strong> (after my Father) <strong>Joseph</strong> (after her uncle Joe) <strong>Heliker</strong>. He's my boy. It's still a bit surreal, of course. I have no idea when it'll \"hit me.\" But he's doing well. Mom is resting comfortably. All seems most groovy.\r\n\r\nThanks to all who've supported/helped us through this process. A big thanks goes to the nursing staff at Central DuPage Hospital... ESPECIALLY Cheryl (day shift) and Kristin (Night Shift)... they were extremely helpful and supportive and kept Julie's spirits up through the tough parts and truly made this experience as comfortable as possible for Julie. Thanks to all of you. \r\n\r\nHe was born 8lbs, 11oz. and 21 inches long. Big and strong... just like his Dad... ;)"
