postDescription: "This is my sensei in a big foam Sumo Suit at our dojo last saturday. She is performing a ju jitsu technique called a Freukemi (sp?). It is a hard fall. She is exceptional at this fall when she's NOT wearing a big, foam Sumo suit. The fact that she can do this WEARING this big, foam Sumo suit... is incredible. Especially since the suit probably weighs as much, if not more, than SHE DOES! As a side note, my camera's buffer filled up before I could get the last shot, but she DID land this fall correctly... It was very impressive!\r\n\r\n(as a side note... I will probably be 'bloodied' for posting this series...but it will be worth it.)"
