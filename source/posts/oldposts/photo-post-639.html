postTitle: "Barn... thingy... "
postDescription: "This is a device that is at the Danada Equestrian Center. It's in the back near the Tool Shed and doesn't get used. It's intended for horses that are a little ornery to somewhat restrain them when they are getting shoed, if I'm not mistaken. It has a bit of a 'medieval' feel to, tho', I think. Also, I'd wager that being restrained would actually make it MORE difficult to work with a horse. If they try to fight against the restraints, they might spook and things would not be pleasant. \r\n\r\nOh.. and today was just a marvelously sunny and pleasant day! The first I've seen in a long while!"
