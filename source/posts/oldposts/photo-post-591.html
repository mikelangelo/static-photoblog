postDescription: "&lt;p&gt;Well... joolie and I went to visit Hattie at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wshs-dg.org/wshs/&quot;&gt;West Suburban Humane Society&lt;/a&gt; in Downers Grove, IL last night. She's an 11 week old great Pyrenese. We had an inside track to the Humane society (Thanks Ann!), so we were able to get grubby paws on her (pun intended) before anyone else. BWAAHAAHAhahahahaaa... uhm.. yah... anyway... Hero and Hattie got to get acquainted for about and hour or so and they seemed to get along very well. They played... we laughed, we cried... two thumbs up all around. &lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;This image is a composite of two shots of Hattie..it was very dark and I was using my new 17-40 f/4.0 L lens...I wasn't thinking or I would have used the nifty 50 at f/1.8 for better results in the dark... oh well.. although not particularly good in the technical sense... I kinda' like how this came out.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Oh.. and we might change her name... Hattie was given to her by her previous owner or the humane society, I'm not sure...but we haven't decided, yet.&lt;/p&gt;"
