postDescription: "My friend gave me some old fashioned, steel Tonka trucks from when he was a kid for MY kids to play with (he's not a kid anymore). I think they are just wonderful. They're a little pointy and rusty for my youngins' to play with right away, although they did play with them for a little bit. In the meantime, I thought they would make marvelous subjects for still life work.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think."
