postTitle: "What's her name?"
postDescription: "This here be my wife's and mine new dog. She's about 3 years old. She's a purebred bloodhound. We got her from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.midwestbloodhoundrescue.com/&quot;&gt;Midwest Bloodhound Rescue&lt;/a&gt; this afternoon. She's quite lovely. She and Hero seem to get along, but there's still some time needed for them to get to know each other. But I think they'll be good friends in the end. As you can see... she loves her rawhide bone!"
