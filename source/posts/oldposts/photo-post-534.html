postDescription: "Yup. Another shot from the first snow this year. Sorry, I haven't made many opportunities to take other shots lately. Camera's been stuck in its bag for a while now. But fear not... I've got some trips to Boston, california, Catlina Island as well as a small town in Mexico (ala California Cruise), so hopefully, I'll have many photos to share... preferably good photos. ;-) Thanks for looking."
