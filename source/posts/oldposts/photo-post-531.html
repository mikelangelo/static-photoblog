postTitle: "Blue Forest"
postDescription: "I actually got up early enough the other day to be able to stop at a forest preserve on my way to work. It was overcast and hazy. Quite lovely, really. I've seen some beautiful atmospheric images of forests at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.durhamtownship.com/blog-archives/002752.html&quot;&gt;A Walk Through Durham Township&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dianevarner.com/index.php?showimage=410&quot;&gt;Daily Walks&lt;/a&gt;, both photoblogs of very talented photographers. I decided I wanted to play with the idea of 'atmosphere' in my images. Granted, I'm not as good as those photographers...but I'm working on it. And it gives me something to shoot for. \r\n\r\nOh.. .and I'm still pretty swamped for the next week or so. I don't know when I'll be able to take photos and post again.Maybe next week sometime."
