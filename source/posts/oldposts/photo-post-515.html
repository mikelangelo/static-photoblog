postTitle: "Doe and Fawn"
postDescription: "Julie and I went on a bike ride this past Saturday on the Illinois Prairie Path. It was a beautiful day for it. We went with our friends Peggy and Warren. We went up to the Fox River and about 1/2 way through the ride, we literally stumbled on two deer that were in the river. This doe was nursing her fawn. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the camera out quick enough to capture that. instead... I get their tails as they were scampering off. sigh... But it was a beautiful day for a ride. "
