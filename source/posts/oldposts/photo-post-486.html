postDescription: "I was helping a friend of mine, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rdhphotography.com/&quot;&gt;Rob Dehaan&lt;/a&gt;, at a photo shoot for a sorority/fraternity conference he was shooting. We arrived early and set up a couple of lights outside for group portraits. I went out a couple of times to check on the lights. I saw this guy walking along the pond's edge. But, I left my camera inside. I came out 45 minutes or so later and he was STILL there... I slapped myself in the forehead for leaving the camera inside... again. Well.. the third time's the charm. about 45 minutes later... I checked the lights... he hadn't moved. And THIS time, I had my camera. \r\n\r\nThe day was HOT and MUGGY... blech. I think he was trying to stay cool in the shade of the tree. The light area on his neck, just under his chin/bill, was fluttering, I believe in an attempt to stay cool.\r\n\r\nThis guy was incredibly brave. He allowed me to get within 30 feet or so of him before he began to move away. I had my Canon 70-200 with 1.4x Teleconverter.\r\n\r\nThe only bummer is he really DIDN'T move. Most of the shots are the same. I'll post one more of him tomorrow..but the two pics will be similar. Nothing earth Shattering in these pics...but it's the closest I've ever gotten to a Blue Heron... It was a good day.\r\n\r\nJust for the record...here's an example of what I'd like to be able to capture someday: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.photoflavor.com/index.php?id=417&quot;&gt;Photoflavor&lt;/a&gt;."
