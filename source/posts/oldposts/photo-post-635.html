postDescription: "This is from the same walk as yesterday's pic. There is a house we pass as we walk to the forest preserve that has outdoor lights on some of their landscaping. This tree always has its bark lit and I think it looks really cool. So, here I am, trying to photograph it. I just hope the folks there didn't see me...I'm in the middle of their front yard just about a foot or so away from their tree, kind of leaning into it... I hope they didn't think I was some kind of weirdo! ;)"
