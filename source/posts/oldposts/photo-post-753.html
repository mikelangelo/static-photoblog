postDescription: "This is a snow capped wilted rose from my backyard. I've downloaded the trial version of Aperture 3 (http://www.apple.com/aperture) and this is the first image I test it out with. Overall, I'm noticing a little performance boost and I'm just starting to play with some of the new features. "
