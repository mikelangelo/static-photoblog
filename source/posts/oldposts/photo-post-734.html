postDescription: "So, while in the arena, charlie began doing some JuJitsu roles.. learning to fall and role can save him a lot of hurt one day. Actually... out of nowhere, he just started doing summersaults in the dirt. i couldn't catch the actually role (I tried) and he only did 2 or 3 times... it was darn cute, tho'."
