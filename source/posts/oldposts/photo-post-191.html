postTitle: "Peace... at last"
postDescription: "If these two can get along... why can't the rest of the world? This again was in Chicago waiting for Episode IV to start on the big screen. I have also mention that the guy with the hood/cape/light sabre on behind Obi Wan is a Sith wanna' be. He didn't resemble anyone of importance. He thought he was cool...sigh... Darth really just should have choked him with the force. He was like the kid in High School who tried to get into every yearbook pic. Sheesh... "
