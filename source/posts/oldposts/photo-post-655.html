postDescription: "This is a gate to a paddock at st. James Farm. Most of the paddocks are fenced with the older lumber, but most of the gates have been painted like this. The yellow color is used on all of the wooden buildings throughout the property. This land was purchased by the DuPage County Forest Preserve when the previous owner passed away. However, the deal is contigent on the property being used for Equestrian activities. The property is currently being restored and there's a 'soft opening' where visitors are welcome, but they're still renovating many parts of the facilities. "
