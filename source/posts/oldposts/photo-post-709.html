postDescription: "Near my wife's work is a farm that has an old dragline shovel sitting out near the road. It's very cool. I had to stop and take photos today. I've got a few of these and they will be posted over the next several days. \r\n\r\nI've also started to play with the processing methods I use in Aperture. Let me know what you think and thanks for looking!"
